What is Bugzilla?
-----------------

Bugzilla is a free bug-tracking system that is developed by an active
community of volunteers in the Mozilla community. You can install and
use it without having to pay any license fee.

What is Bugzilla4Intranet?
--------------------------

Bugzilla4Intranet is a highly improved fork of Bugzilla version 3.6.4,
targeted at being a Fast and Customisable bug-tracker, and at cleaning
Bugzilla code, which contains a lot of hardcoded behaviour and just
ugly ideas or implementations.

Of course that's an ideal goal :-)

Minimum requirements
--------------------

Bugzilla4Intranet definitely works on GNU/Linux systems and should also work
on *BSD, other UNIX flavors and even Windows and Mac OS X.

Bugzilla is written in Perl, meaning that Perl and some Perl modules must be
installed on your system. Some of them contain C code which requires compilation.

You will also need a database server. Supported ones are MySQL and PostgreSQL;
there is also support for Oracle, though it is untested for long time and may be broken.

Bugzilla4Intranet Quick Start Guide
-----------------------------------
(or, how to get Bugzilla up and running in 10 steps) +
Vitaliy Filippov <vitalif@mail.ru>

This express installation guide is for "normal" Bugzilla installations,
which means a Linux or Unix system on which Perl, MySQL or PostgreSQL
and a Sendmail compatible MTA are available. For other configurations, please
see the "Installing Bugzilla" section of the Bugzilla Guide in the docs/ directory.

1. Decide from which URL and directory you will be serving the Bugzilla webpages.

2. Unpack the distribution into the chosen directory (there is no copying or installation involved).

3. Install Perl modules, better globally by running CPAN shell, which is
   'cpan' or 'perl -MCPAN -eshell' if you have no 'cpan' executable in PATH.
+
--
Minimal requirements are:

   sudo cpan Date::Parse DBI CGI DateTime Email::Address \
     Template JSON Email::MIME Test::Taint \
     XML::Twig Text::TabularDisplay Email::Sender \
     Lingua::Translit Archive::Zip \
     DBD::mysql Image::Magick

For the full installation, you also need the following modules:

   sudo cpan GD Template::Plugin::GD GD::Graph GD::Graph3d \
     MIME::Parser Mail::RFC822::Address Email::Reply \
     Devel::StackTrace Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper \
     SOAP::Lite JSON::RPC JSON::XS Text::CSV HTML::Strip \
     Text::CSV_XS Spreadsheet::ParseExcel Spreadsheet::XLSX \
     Lingua::Stem::Snowball Math::Random::Secure TheSchwartz \
     Daemon::Generic HTTP::Server::Simple Net::Server Sys::Sendfile

If you want to use PostgreSQL, you need DBD::pg instead of DBD::mysql.

Some of these contain C code and require a working compiler toolchain and appropriate
system libraries and their "development" packages ('-devel' or '-dev') for installation:
for example, DBD::mysql needs 'libmysqlclient-dev', GD needs 'libgd2-dev' and etc.
Install these with your Linux distro's package manager.

Your Linux distribution may have some of required perl modules available pre-built;
you may install them with package manager if they're sufficiently up to date.
For example, it's usually simpler to install Image::Magick with 'apt-get install perlmagick'
on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
--

4. Run ./checksetup.pl. It will first check for installed Perl modules and a MTA,
   and then complain that localconfig needs to be edited.
+
--
NOTE: You can run checksetup as many times as necessary at any moment to check
that everything required has been installed, DB is set up and etc.
--
5. Create MySQL/PostgreSQL database and user with full access to it.

6. Edit the localconfig file, in particular the $webservergroup and $db_* variables
   which define database connection details, name, user and password.

7. Run checksetup.pl once more; if all goes well, it should set up the
   Bugzilla database for you.
+
--
checksetup.pl should ask you, this time, for the administrator's
email address and password. These will be used for the initial
Bugzilla administrator account.
--
8. Recommended way is to use standalone pure-perl HTTP server - HTTPServerSimple.pl;
   placing it behind a fast frontend server like nginx (http://nginx.org) is probably
   more secure, but it's possible to use it even without any frontend. In this case
   the simplest way to start Bugzilla is to run
+
--
   sudo ./HTTPServerSimple.pl --port [HOST:]PORT --user USER --group GROUP

Where HOST and PORT are the desired host and port which Bugzilla should listen on,
and USER and GROUP are the system user/group for running the web server process.

For example, to listen port 8157 on all network interfaces under Debian Linux:

   sudo ./HTTPServerSimple.pl --port 0.0.0.0:8157 --user www-data --group www-data

For more advanced configuration see the end of HTTPServerSimple.pl file - there
are all the configuration options that you can override. You may specify these
options on the commandline like above, or put them in a configuration file and
use it with

   sudo ./HTTPServerSimple.pl /path/to/config.file

To install a service, just put the above command into '/etc/rc.local' or copy
'contrib/init.d/bugzilla' script (for Debian) to '/etc/init.d'.
--
9. Another way is to use Apache and mod_perl. In this case create a virtual host
   with document root pointing to bugzilla installation directory and add the
   following into its configuration:

   PerlOptions +Parent
   PerlOptions +GlobalRequest
   PerlSwitches -T -I/path/to/bugzilla
   PerlModule Apache::XMLRPC::Lite
   PerlConfigRequire /path/to/bugzilla/mod_perl.pl

10. Visit the URL you chose for Bugzilla. Your browser should display the
    default Bugzilla home page. You should then log in as the
    administrator by following the "Log in" link and supplying the
    account information you provided in step 7.

11. Visit the "Parameters" page, as suggested by the page displayed to you.
    Set up the relevant parameters for your local setup.

12. That's it. If anything unexpected comes up:

    - read the error message carefully,
    - backtrack through the steps above,
    - check the installation guide,
    - if nothing helps, file a bug here: http://github.com/vitalif/bugzilla-4intranet/issues

Note that Bugzilla4Intranet differs from the original Bugzilla, so bug reports
should be filed at our GitHub page (at the above URL), not in the Mozilla bugtracker.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for Bugzilla4Intranet is based on the original Bugzilla 3.6.4
documentation, translated to asciidoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc) format.

It's still a work in progress - some parts are up-to-date for Bugzilla4Intranet and some are not.

See link:$$docs/en/html/Bugzilla-Guide.html$$[] and link:$$docs/en/asciidoc/Bugzilla-Guide.asciidoc$$[] (source).

You can also read the documentation for the *original* Bugzilla on its official site:
