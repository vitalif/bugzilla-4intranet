== UNRELEASED: beta ==

UI improvements:
* Redesign of bug entry form - now it has 2 columns, one with "bigger" fields
  like description and "textarea" custom fields, and another with "smaller"
  selectbox, user, and text edit fields.
* Redesign of bug change form - now fields are displayed in 4 columns,
  and editboxes are under their labels instead of being in the next column.
* Separate localisation layer - now it's possible to translate Bugzilla UI
  without copying templates!
* More cute Mozilla skin integrated and used by default.
* Simple "responsive layout" using CSS media queries in Mozilla skin:
  * On the bug entry form, 2 columns become 1 on a narrow screen.
  * On the bug change form, 4 columns become 2 or also 1 based on the screen width.
* Gravatar support.
* Various general style improvements.

Backports from original Bugzilla 4.4:
* Upgrade compatibility: allow to upgrade original Bugzilla 4.4
  to Bugzilla4Intranet.
* Allow to disable old versions/milestones.
* Saved reports.
* Add user "last seen date".

Bug field improvements:
* "Reverse BUG_ID relationship" field type.
* Replace "unspecified" versions with NULL.
* Dependent default values for all custom and some standard fields.
* Dependent nullability, i.e. allow or deny empty values dependent on the
  value of another select field.
* Dependent cloneability, i.e. allow to select whether to clone custom fields
  dependent on the value of another select field.
* Allow to enable fields or values for the empty value of their controller.
* UI to enable/disable dependent fields from the controlling value page (i.e. for example from the product page).
* Remove "Bug Fields" parameters (defaultXXX, useXXX) - now all fields are edited using "Fields" UI.
* For standard fields, show the exact parameters that you're allowed to tweak.
* Sort fields in bugmail and history by their sortkey.
* Do not treat empty visibility value sets as "visible for all" anymore.
* Allow to delete custom fields with change history.
* Allow to configure default milestones and versions based on other fields (for example, based on components).
* Allow keywords to depend on other fields (for example on product).

Other new features:
* Link to "Add/remove users in this group" from product page.
* Better 'makeproductgroups' handling - do not insert group into all products
  by default when it is on, always allow to choose whether to create access
  group for new products.
* Rewrite group control help text.
* Allow to use shared searches in "matched by saved search" operator (with
  'SearchName <user@domain.com>' syntax), allow to run shared searches that
  use other shared searches (they crashed previously).
* Improved Boolean Charts UI: negation is now also added as a fieldset
  (this looks more intuitive).
* Reflow custom fields on query forms to form 4-field rows on dynamic hide/show.
* Use "DOM ready" event instead of window.onload to speedup bug/query form loading.
* Allow to use LEVENSHTEIN() user search with PostgreSQL.
* HTTPServerSimple.pl: prevent possible path traversal.
* Do not require HTML::Scrubber to correctly strip unsafe tags.
* Allow to change product classification from product page.
* Move OS and Platform guessing regexps into DB and allow to edit them.
* Allow to use field names in incoming email.
* Flash comment when going to its anchor link.
* Detect changes for multi-selects during mid-air collisions.

Bugfixes:
* More correct select field population on bug and query forms.
* Fix read-only display of bug fields to work again.
* sanitycheck.cgi fixed and works again.
* Make "Clear flag requests when closing bugs" preference actually work.

Refactoring:
* Remove CGI.pm usage for getting query parameters and cookies from everywhere.
  *.cgi scripts now use Bugzilla->input_params and Bugzilla->cookies hashrefs.
  Bugzilla::Search, Search::Saved, Report, Chart and similar now use plain hashrefs
  instead of CGI object for passing params.
  This is faster, looks much more readable, and automatically avoids
  vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-1572 (found recently in original Bugzilla).
* Refactor result reporting, move the rest of bug-related code into Bugzilla::Bug.
  This allows to not call process_bug.cgi from importxls.cgi and email_in.pl anymore.
* All CUSTIS-specific features moved into 'custishacks' extension; all non-specific
  features moved from 'custis' extension into core.
* Merge create/edit templates for milestones, versions, field values, keywords, classifications.
* Remove JOB_MAP hardcode that didn't allow to add custom job classes without
  modifying the core code.
* Remove various procedural and/or unused APIs from Bugzilla modules,
  (like is_open_state, BUG_STATE_OPEN, closed_bug_statuses, LookupNamedQuery...)
* Remove some unused functions and filters from Bugzilla::Template.
* Remove some never-used obsolete field definitions from the DB.
* Remove "additional scrum estimates" (was mostly unused).
* Move some DB interaction code from editflagtypes.cgi to Bugzilla::FlagType.
* Make products.cc_group and flagtypes.cc_list also store ID.
* Change the rest of integer fields to be INT4 during upgrade.
* Convert Keywords into a standard multi-select field.
* Update code style for all *.cgi, for all *.js and for most Bugzilla modules.
