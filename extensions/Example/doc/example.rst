Example
#######

This is a sample documentation file for the Example extension. Like all of
the Bugzilla docs, it's written in
`reStructured Text (reST) format <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/rest.html>`_
and will be compiled by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

If you build the docs yourself using :file:`makedocs.pl`, this file will get
incorporated into the Extensions chapter, as will any documentation
you write for your extensions which fulfils the following criteria:

* In the :file:`extensions/YourExtension/doc/` directory
* Has a :file:`.rst` file extension

You are recommended to make the name of your reST doc file the same as the
name of your extension, so that there is no clash when all the extension
documentation is copied into the same directory. So, for example, this file
is called :file:`example.rst`, as it's part of the Example extension. If you
need multiple documentation files, prefix the filename with the name of your
extension, e.g. :file:`example-extra.rst`.
