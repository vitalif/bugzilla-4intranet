This directory contains drivers for the XMLRPC interface to Testopia. These
drivers can be used as stand-alone accessors to the XMLRPC or provide an 
example for proper access in their respective languages.

With the exception of the Perl driver, each has been contributed generously
by members of the community. Thus, the Testopia developers cannot provide
support for any driver except the Perl driver (client.pl). Where contact 
information is provided, you may contact the original developers for support.

As changes are made to the XMLRPC interface, the drivers tend to lag behind 
(with the noted exception of the Perl driver which is used by the developers 
to test the interface and is therefore kept current). Please check that the 
driver you choose is up to date with the current version of the API. If it is 
not, we welcome you to help bring it up to date by providing patches.
