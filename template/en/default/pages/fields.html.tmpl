          Nobody has confirmed that this [% terms.bug %] is valid. Users
          who have the "canconfirm" permission set may confirm
          this [% terms.bug %], changing its state to 
          <b>[% display_value("bug_status", "NEW") FILTER html %]</b>. 
          Or, it may be directly resolved and marked

          This [% terms.bug %] is valid and has recently been filed.
          [%+ terms.Bugs %] in this state become 
          <b>[% display_value("bug_status", "ASSIGNED") FILTER html %]</b> when
          somebody is working on them, or become resolved and marked

          This [% terms.bug %] is not yet resolved, but is assigned to the
          proper person who is working on the [% terms.bug %]. From here,
          [%+ terms.bugs %] can be given to another person and become

          This [% terms.bug %] was once resolved, but the resolution was
          deemed incorrect. For example, a 
          <b>[% display_value("resolution", "WORKSFORME") FILTER html %]</b>
          [%+ terms.bug %] is marked 
          <b>[% display_value("bug_status", "REOPENED") FILTER html %]</b> when
          more information shows up and the [% terms.bug %] is now
          reproducible. From here, [% terms.bugs %] are either marked 
          <b>[% display_value("bug_status", "ASSIGNED") FILTER html %]</b> or
          <b>[% display_value("bug_status", "RESOLVED") FILTER html %]</b>.

          A resolution has been performed, and it is awaiting verification by
          QA. From here [% terms.bugs %] are either re-opened and become

          QA has looked at the [% terms.bug %] and the resolution and
          agrees that the appropriate resolution has been taken. 
          [%+ terms.Bugs %] remain in this state until the product they were
          reported against actually ships, at which point they become

          The [% terms.bug %] is considered dead, the resolution is correct.
