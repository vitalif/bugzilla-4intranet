Welcome to Testopia!

Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to 
be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing 
organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. 
Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track 
testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

=== Requirements ===
* Bugzilla 3.0.x 
* Perl JSON 2.07+ 
* Ext JS library 2.2 (included in tarball)

Testopia is an extension to Bugzilla. This means that if you have one of the
supported versions of Bugzilla installed, you are all set to install Testopia.
Installation instructions for Bugzilla can be found at http://bugzilla.org

Note: The following assumes you have installed Bugzilla according to the 
Bugzilla tarball instructions. Installations from Debian .deb or from some RPM packages
may place Bugzilla files in separate directories in which case, these will not
work.

=== Installation on Linux ===
                                   
''' From the tarball: '''
If you are installing Testopia from the release tarball, simply untar the
tarball in your bugzilla top level directory. On Linux this would look
something like this:

  $> cp testopia-<version>.tar.gz /path/to/bugzilla
  $> cd /path/to/bugzilla
  $> tar xzvf testopia-<version>.tar.gz

Next you need to patch the Bugzilla files. For Bugzilla 3.0:
 
  $> patch -p0 -i testopia/patch-3.0
 
For Bugzilla 3.0.1+:
 
  $> patch -p0 -i testopia/patch-3.0.x
  
Finally, you need to run checksetup.pl

  $> ./checksetup.pl
  

''' From CVS: '''
If you want to install the latest code from CVS you will need to do the 
following:

1. Check out the CVS code in a temporary location

  $> export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot
  $> cvs login
  (Logging in to anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org)
  CVS password: anonymous

  $> cvs co Testopia

2. You will now make a tarball of the source. If you like to update your 
Bugzilla from CVS, be sure to delete the top level CVS direcory first.

  $> cd mozilla/webtools/testopia
  $> rm -rf CVS
  $> tar cvf /tmp/testopia.tar .

Once you have your tarball, follow the instructions above to untar it into your
Bugzilla directory  The last step is to 
install the Ext libraries:

  $> cd path/to/bugzilla/testopia/
  $> wget http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-2.0.1.zip
  $> unzip ext-2.0.1.zip
  $> mv ext-2.0.1 extjs

Congratulations, you should be able to see the Testopia links at the bottom of
your bugzilla pages. 

=== Installation on Windows ===

Windows installations are not officially supported. By this we mean don't ask the
developers for help as we have never tried to install on Windows and don't have 
any desire to. However, there have been numerous users that have managed to do
so on their own. Here are some pointers:

    1. Rename the patch file to have a .txt extension. You may also want to 
       convert the patch to use DOS line endings using a utility such as 
       unix2dos or you will need use the --binary flag on the patch command.
    
    2. Download GNU Patch and install it in a directory in your path.
       It can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm

    3. Correct the Perl paths from the default:
    
       C:\<apache path>\htdocs\bugzilla> <MySQL path>\bin\replace.exe" "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" -- *.cgi *.pl
       C:\<apache path>\htdocs\bugzilla\Bugzilla> <MySQL path>\bin\replace.exe" "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" -- *.pm

From here the steps should be fairly identical to those above, meaning patch
the files and run checksetup.pl.

If you have problems please post questions to the support-webtools list. Do not
email the developers directly.

If you find additional pointers, please post them to the Wiki version of this file at 
http://wiki.mozilla.org/Testopia:README

=== Upgrading ===

'''Upgrading on Bugzilla 3.0.x from Testopia 1.3 to 2.0:'''

    1. Reverse the patch by running the command above with the -R option.
    2. Follow the steps above to untar, reapply the patch, and run checksetup.

'''Upgrading from Bugzilla 2.22:'''

You should first reverse the 2.22 patch with 
    
    $> patch -p2 -R -i testopia/patch-2.22

As Testopia 2.0 is designed to work only with Bugzilla 3.0.x, you must first
upgrade Bugzilla. You can follow the instructions from http://bugzilla.org to 
do this. 

From there, follow the installation instructions above.

'''Upgrading to latest from CVS:'''

Testopia comes with a script to update to the lates checked in version (trunk or tip). 
WARNING: This should only be done against the latest released version. The tip is 
considered unstable.

    $<path to bugzilla>/testopia/contrib> bash cvs_update.sh /path/to/bugzilla

The script can be modified to checkout a tag or version if you know what you 
are doing.
